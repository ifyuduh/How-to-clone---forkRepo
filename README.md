This is a breakdown on how to clone and fork a repository. 

Think of a repository as a big box where you keep all the stuff related to a project or a piece of software. This "box" can hold things like the actual code you write, notes about how the code works, pictures, documents, and even instructions on how to use the software.

**Step 1:** First you create the repository by logging into your Github account and you select the + button at the top right that says create new, then you click new repository

**## HOW TO FORK A REPOSITORY**

When you "fork" a repository on platforms like GitHub, you're making a copy of someone else's project. This copy is now yours to tinker with and modify without altering the original project. You can add new features, fix bugs, or make any changes you want to fit your needs. Forking is often used when you want to contribute to someone else's project or when you want to start your own project based on someone else's work.

First you open the repository link, then select fork.
